Each question is answered in two seperated Notebooks. 

Question 1

I used a sqlite Database for the first question. It took a me long time to find a way to convert the .csv into .db. I am not sure that using a sqlite database is the best. I think it's smarter to use a sqlite database for smaller ones.

Question 2

I used dictionaries. It was a choice as I felt it was easier for clustering reasons. Also, I did not have the time to change my code to compute the real shortage rate for all stores. The result is in the Result.csv file.
